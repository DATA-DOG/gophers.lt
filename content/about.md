### About

This is a home of gopher user community in Lithuania.

Since we know for sure that by 2017 most of the programs will be written in **go**, we have decided to
open a community in Lithuania.

So far we are a small group of gophers mainly located in city **Kaunas**, trying to reach out to everyone,
who is interested in mastering this language and enjoys programming in overall.

#### What are our plans

We plan to organize some events to gather gophers around our dear country and have fun together.

Well, we plan to kill the blue elephant in the end anyways.
