## Agenda

1. Osvaldas Grigas - **"Communicating Sequential Processes"**
2. Gediminas Morkevicius - **"Acceptance and integration testing with godog"**

*Communicating Sequential Processes* - CSP's parallel programming model has strongly influenced Go,
Clojure and other languages. Let's take a look at the original 1978 [CSP paper by Tony Hoare](http://spinroot.com/courses/summer/Papers/hoare_1978.pdf),
including a bit of history and elegant solutions to hard concurrency problems.

*Acceptance and integration testing with godog* - Behavior driven development (BDD) framework for golang.
Godog is cucumber implementation for GO.
