2. Povilas Versockas - **"Advanced Testing with Go"**
3. Jonas A - **"Go and Plan 9"**

__Intro to GO performance__ - Going through a simple web server implementation performance details and demonstration

__Advanced Testing with Go__ - NA

__Go and Plan 9__ - I will talk about the relationship between the Plan 9 operating system and the Go programming language. They share many common ideas, which is not so surprising given common developers, e.g. Rob Pike, Ken Thompson and Russ Cox. I also will also show how to crosscompile the toolchain to run under Plan 9 on Rasberry Pi.
